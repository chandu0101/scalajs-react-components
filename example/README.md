Welcome to the reactjs-component example project!

This is a dead simple, standalone, "hello world" project that shows you how to get started with a
scalajs-react-components project.

Simply clone this project and run

sbt
fastOptJS::webpack
fastOptJS::startWebpackDevServer

For a much bigger example of all the components, look at the demo project!
