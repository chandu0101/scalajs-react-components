Part of the Philosophia Magna, this book was first printed in 1566 after Paracelsus' death. He wrote the book to \"describe the creatures that are outside the cognizance of the light of nature, how they are to be understood, what marvellous works God has created\". He states that there is more bliss in describing these \"divine objects\" than in describing fencing, court etiquette, cavalry, and other worldly pursuits."),

Paracelsus gave common names for the elemental types, as well as correct names, which he seems to have considered somewhat more proper, \"recht namen\". He also referred to them by purely German terms which are roughly equivalent to \"water people,\" \"mountain people,\" and so on, using all the different forms interchangeably.")),
